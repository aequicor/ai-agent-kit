## Description

What the smell/duplication/warning is, in 2-4 sentences. Be specific — name functions, modules, libraries. A reader who has not seen this code should be able to grasp the issue.

---

## Why not critical now

One sentence on why this was deferred rather than fixed in place. Examples:
- Out of scope for the current task — would expand the diff beyond review tolerance.
- Compiler/linter warning that does not affect runtime behavior.
- Duplicated code is short and the abstraction is not yet clear.
- Deprecation with a documented migration path that requires a separate plan.

---

## Suggested fix (optional)

If the fix shape is already clear, sketch it in 2-5 bullets. Otherwise leave this section empty — `/kit-techdebt` will plan it.
