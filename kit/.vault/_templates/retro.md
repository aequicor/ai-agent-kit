# Retrospective — <feature>

**Module:** <module>
**Feature:** <feature-slug>
**Created:** YYYY-MM-DD

## How this file works

Optional per-feature file. Created on first bug fix or post-incident review for the feature; subsequent entries append below. v4 wrote each bug fix to a separate file in `guidelines/<module>/reports/`; v5 keeps everything per-feature so the history reads end-to-end.

Entries are written by `@BugFixer` after a fix, or by the `bug-retro` skill (mandatory for CRITICAL/HIGH defects).
